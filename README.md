# Battery Discharge and Capacity Test System
During my bachelor's degree final year at Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP), I developed a Battery Discharge and Capacity Test System using an ATMega328P microcontroller and MATLAB to capture serial communication data, making real-time graphics and with the ability to export to .csv file.
The deviceâ€™s implementation was done by using an Arduino board and by discharging the battery over a constant current load. During the test, the capacity, discharge current, battery voltage and discharge time are measured. The exterior case was developed by an 3D modelling software and then the construction of the case was made. Using the USB port, it is possible to record all the data mentioned above by the serial monitor when connected to a computer.

**Device Functionalities** 

Measurement of Capacity

Measurement of Internal Resistance

Temperature of the Constant Current Load circuit

Serial Communication using UART 

MATLAB integration which allows to plot real-time graphics of all the variables measured.

Integrated Cooling System (5V Fan)
